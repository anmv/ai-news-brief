    Create a strategic AI news briefing for Applied Science Managers and Data Science Managers based on this TLDR AI newsletter from {date}.

    CRITICAL: Preserve the actual news content - specific company names, product launches, research findings, and concrete developments. Don't turn everything into abstract concepts.

    For each significant news item, provide:
    
    <h3>[Specific headline - use actual company/product names]</h3>
    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> [Detailed factual summary - provide comprehensive context about who did what, when, how, and with what specific details. For unfamiliar companies or concepts, include brief definitions (e.g., "CoreWeave, a cloud service provider specializing in AI infrastructure, announced..."). Include technical specifications, timelines, and background context.]</p>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> [Explain the strategic importance AND what specific problem this solves or opportunity it creates. Address both immediate business impact and longer-term implications for AI/ML teams and competitive positioning.]</p>
    <p><strong>Management Action:</strong> [Specific next steps - evaluate, pilot, monitor, invest, or ignore - with clear rationale]</p>

    WRITING GUIDELINES:
    - Use actual company names (OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, etc.)
    - For lesser-known companies, provide brief context (e.g., "Sakana AI, a Tokyo-based AI research company,...")
    - Include specific products, features, numbers, dates, and technical details
    - Preserve research findings and their implications
    - Make "What Happened" sections comprehensive - don't just summarize, provide full context
    - In "Why It Matters", always explain what problem is being solved or opportunity created

    AUDIENCE: Technical managers who need comprehensive news facts AND strategic context to make informed decisions.

    FORMATTING:
    - Generate clean HTML with <h2>, <h3>, <p>, <strong> tags
    - Start with <h2>AI News Briefing - {date}</h2>
    - Under 1000 words total (expanded for more detail)
    - Focus on 4-6 most important developments
    - Professional, informative tone
