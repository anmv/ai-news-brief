# Strategic AI News Briefing for Applied Science & Data Science Managers

A Python tool that transforms generic TLDR AI newsletters into strategic briefings tailored specifically for Applied Science Managers and Data Science Managers. Get business implications, team impact, and actionable insights from the latest AI developments. Available as both a command-line tool and web interface.

## Problem Statement

Applied Science Managers and Data Science Managers face a critical challenge: TLDR AI newsletters cover everything, but most content isn't strategically relevant for management decision-making. Generic AI news lacks the business context, implementation feasibility analysis, and team impact insights that managers need for resource allocation, technology adoption, and competitive positioning decisions. This tool addresses this gap by transforming generic AI news into management-focused strategic briefings.

## How It Works (Methodology)

The application follows a three-step automated pipeline:

1.  **Web Scraping & Data Acquisition**: The script first identifies and fetches the URL for the most recent edition of the TLDR AI Newsletter, a curated source of relevant articles. It then parses this newsletter to extract the URLs of the primary source articles.

2.  **Content Aggregation**: Each source article URL is visited, and its core textual content is extracted. This raw text from multiple sources is aggregated into a single corpus for analysis.

3.  **AI-Powered Summarization & Analysis**: The aggregated text is passed to Google's Gemini Pro 1.5 model. A specific, engineered prompt instructs the model to act as an assistant to an Applied Science Manager. It synthesizes the information and generates a structured summary, focusing not just on *what* the technology is, but on its *so what*â€”its potential applications, feasibility, and business impact. The tool then provides an interactive Q&A session on the summarized content.

## Tech Stack

-   **Language**: Python 3
-   **Core Libraries**:
    -   `requests` & `BeautifulSoup4`: For web scraping and HTML parsing.
    -   `google-generativeai`: For interacting with the Gemini API.
    -   `python-dotenv`: For secure management of API keys.
    -   `flask`: For the web interface.

## Setup & Usage

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/christophercosler/ai-news-briefing.git
cd ai-news-briefing
```

**2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Set up your API Key:**
   - Create a file named `.env` in the project root.
   - Add your Gemini API key to this file:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

**4. Run the tool:**

Command line version:
```bash
python main.py
```

Web interface version:
```bash
python web_app.py
```
Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

AI BRIEFING - TLDR NEWSLETTER 2025-06-29
================================================================================

Here is a summary of the key developments from today's articles:

**1. Large Language Model (LLM) Pruning Techniques**

* **Core Idea**: A new technique called "Sparse-Quant" allows for reducing the size of large language models by up to 80% with minimal impact on performance.
* **Potential Application**: This could enable the deployment of powerful LLMs on edge devices like smartphones or in resource-constrained cloud environments, reducing inference costs significantly.
* **Technical Feasibility**: High. The paper provides open-source code for implementation. Requires expertise in model optimization but leverages existing frameworks.
* **Strategic Value**: Unlocks new product categories for on-device AI. Provides a competitive advantage by drastically lowering operational costs for AI features.
